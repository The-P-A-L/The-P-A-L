Hello there 👋

I'm **The P.A.L.** (Alexandre, if you're not a fan of nicknames)

French PowerPoint enjoyer, newbie photographer, cooker and video game maker. 

By the way, we *don't* eat frogs in France. Or at least I don't...

Also, I speak both French and English (besides other languages), so feel free to get in touch if you want 👍
